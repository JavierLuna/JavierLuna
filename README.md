# Javier's User Manual

Hi! Welcome to my [Person User Manual](https://openpracticelibrary.com/practice/personal-user-manuals/). Hopefully this document will help you to know how I am as a human being and how I work best 🙂

## About me 🙋‍♂️

I like to be called `Javi` ([pronuntiation](https://app2.nameshouts.com/names/public/pronounce-javi), `he/him/his`). You will see that I usually write `Javier`, my full name, but I don't like to be called that way.

I speak 🇪🇸 and 🇬🇧 fluently (and I babble in 🇫🇷).

In a nutshell, I am...
- **Shy**: It takes some time for me to ramp up with new people and until then I'm usually quiet. 
	- This never applies in professional conversations/meetings.
- **Sociable**: Talking and meeting with people makes me feel happy, comfortable and included.
- **Playful**: I enjoy life (and work) with a healthy dose of light-hearted humour.
- **Introverted**: Social interactions drain my 'inner battery' and will make me quieter, but don't worry I am fine and still enjoying. I prefer a small amount of people or 1:1 time over big gatherings.


## Conditions I like to work in 🖥
- **I need to work beside a window**. I'm like a 🪴: I need direct sunlight, the lack of it greatly affects my mood. Additionally, views from the windows inspire me and help me think.
- I am most productive with **two monitors** and with my own keyboard and mouse.
- **I highly prefer going to the office** as opposed to working remote, but I trully appreciate the possibility of being **remote from time to time**.


## The times/Hours I like to work 🕰
- **I work from 9:00 to 18:00 (±1h)** with one hour for lunch. I am very respectful about that aspect of my work/life balance.
- **I am flexible in special ocassions**: I can accomodate weirdly scheduled meetings as long as they are ocassional, justified and announced in advance.


## The best ways to communicate with me 📬
**I like both sync and async** communication, for me they serve different purposes:
- Async
	- Leave me a **message** (I like Slack) **with as much context and information that I might need to assist you** (https://nohello.net/, although do say 'hello' 😁).
	- Give me a **buffer of 1h/2hs to reply**, I might be busy.
	- **I might be outside of working hours** (see above). You can still send the message, I'll get back to you as soon as I start working again.
- Sync
	- If you need a quick ad-hoc call **leave me a message first** and we'll work it out.
	- If you want more than a quick call, **schedule a meeting and send me the calendar invite** and we'll work it out. Please **include an agenda**, I don't like uncertainty.
- Important? Page me!

## The ways I like to receive feedback ⚡️
- For me a **good feedback contains**: **1) observed behaviour**, **2) why do you think it is good/bad**, **3) specific example**, and if bad **4) actionable advice to correct the situation**.
- **Be a normal person**. Normal people don't say "I want to give you feedback on X", they say "Hey, I wanted to talk about our past meeting...". The former expression makes me tense in advance.
- **I might have had a bad day**. If you suspect that it might have been the case I would appreciate if you could **wait until a better moment if it is bad feedback**. If it is good, you might make my day by sharing 🙂
- If not, please share your feedback whenever you are most comfortable. You don't have to wait for 1:1s.

## Things I need ✔️
- **Trust**: Everything I do I do with my best intentions, judgement and energy. I perform my best when there's mutual trust between colleagues.
- **Be mindful and respectful of my time**:  I like to help people, but I also suck at time management. Please only ask for assistance if you really need it.
- **\[Manager\] Clear reporting stream**: I'm quite good at self-organizing and I'd love to have a single async way of reporting status.

## Things I struggle with 🙀
- **Time management**: I'm still calibrating on when I should say 'yes' or 'no' to commitments. Explicitly mentioning if my attendance is optional or not would be a great way of helping me with this.
- **Getting lost in unimportant details in discussions**: If, let's say during a design review meeting, you catch me talking about a detail that doesn't really affect the whole design, please remind me.
- **Company/org/project politics**: I'm usually oblivious about company politics and I feel lost whenever I find myself in the center of a political decision I didn't know it was political.

## Things I love ❤️
- Collaborating with a colleague on the same project.
- Presenting or sharing something I learned.
- Problem solving.
- Parrots 🦜, they are super cool.
